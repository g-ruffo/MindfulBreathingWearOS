<img src="./images/1.png" width="35%">
Mindful Breathing app is designed to offer users an interactive experience with their heart rate data, coupled with an educational glimpse into data storage dynamics. With the additional feature of simulating connectivity loss, users can gain insights into how data storage transitions between temporary caching and permanent storage.

## Features

- Heart Rate Monitoring: Real-time display of the user's current heart rate.
- Data Storage Exploration: Dive into the mechanics of data caching and storage, observing how data transitions between temporary memory and the local database.
- Connectivity Simulation: Experience what happens when there's a connectivity loss. Users can set a timer to simulate a connection drop, observing the behavior of the caching system in response.
